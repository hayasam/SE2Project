\textbf{Risk ID} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Probability} & \textbf{Impact} \\ \hline
RK0 & \textit{Marketing of solution}: the main problem of this project is that its features can be easily replicated by some open source mobile application which could stole us the profit of the selling of our product & $<$ 60\% & Serious \\ \hline
RK1 & \textit{Lack of personnel}: Unless we decide to hire new developers, our organization will not be able to finish the project by the requested deadline & $>60 \%$ & Catastrophic \\ \hline
RK2 & \textit{Illness of one or more of the developers} & $< 40 \%$ & Serious \\ \hline
RK3 & \textit{Lack of experience of the personnel}: this is due to the possibility that some of the developers is not familiar with the JEE environment of the Java programming language & $<30\%$ & Medium \\ \hline
RK4 & \textit{Client's abandonment of the project}: there is the possibility that the client decides to stop the project because of his lack of funds & $<10 \%$ & Catastrophic \\ \hline
RK5 & \textit{Lack of budget}: our company may lose to much money in the development and testing of this application & $>30 \%$ & Serious \\ \hline

\textbf{Managed risks} & \textbf{Strategy description} \\ \hline
RK1, RK2, RK3 & \textit{Staff formation and hiring}: in the first phases of the project, and in particular during the planning, hire one/two new developers having a previous background with the Java Programming language and JEE environment. Train them with the support of the expert team members for 15 days. Manage the resource allocation appropriately in order to have full coverage of the development phase also in case of illness of one of the developers. \\ \hline
