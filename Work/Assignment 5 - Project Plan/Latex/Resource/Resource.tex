\chapter{Resource allocation}

\section{Resources identification}
The team of the project has two members with the same role. The members are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Luca Nanni
	\item Giacomo Servadei
\end{itemize}

\section{Allocation Diagram}
In the following diagram is shown the allocation over time of the two resources for the tasks of the project. When the task is represented with blue, it means that the team member is completely dedicated to the task. If it is green, it means that the resource only spent the percentage of time indicated for the task. Finally, the red color means that the resource is working on two different tasks at the same time.
