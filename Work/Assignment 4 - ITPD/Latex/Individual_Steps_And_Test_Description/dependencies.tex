\section{Dependencies}
Here we show the dependency graph between the integrations. An arrow from integration $I_i$ to integration $I_j$ means that integration $I_i$ needs first the execution of integration $I_j$ in order to be carried on.

A possible integration plan is showed in figure \ref{fig:schedule}

\end{figure}
As we notice, we can introduce some parallelism between the different integrations.
