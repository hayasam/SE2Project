\section{Entry Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each component defined in the Design Document has to be already implemented
	\item Each component must be already tested at module level
	\item The interactions between the single components and external services (i.e. Google Maps API) must be already tested and implemented
	\item Interaction between single components and Data Layer must be already implemented and the API (in this case Hibernate) used for accessing the DBMS must be already tested
	\item The client applications must be already implemented and tested at module and integration level. We will not provide an integration plan for the components inside these applications. 
\end{itemize}
