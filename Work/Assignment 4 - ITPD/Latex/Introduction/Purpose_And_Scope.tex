\section{Purpose and scope}
\paragraph{}This document represents the \textit{Integration Test Plan} for the application \textit{myTaxiService}.
\paragraph{Purpose} The purpose of this document is to test the interaction between the components of the system, in particular the interfaces provided by the single components and how these are used by others.\\ It will be defined an integration test plan with the sequence of components integrations, the entry criteria, the strategy and tools to be used for the execution of the plan.

\paragraph{Scope} Here we summarize the main scope of the application.\\
The client is the \textit{government of a large city}.\\
This city already offers a taxi service to its citizens, but the government wants to improve it using a modern and efficient information system.\\
So we received the request to design and implement this application, called \textit{myTaxiService} which has basically two great objectives:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simplify the usage of the taxi service
\item Guarantee an efficient management of the taxi queues
\end{itemize}
