\subsection{User interfaces}
Here we present the mock-ups of the application user interface.\\
We will present the user interface regarding only the two mobile applications (one for the Passengers and one for the Taxi Drivers).\\
The web application interface for the Passenger is a natural extension of the mobile one.
\subsubsection{Home page for the Passenger}

\begin{itemize}
\item Request an immediate taxi service
\item Reserve a taxi for a future journey
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Request for an immediate taxi}

\begin{itemize}
\item Insert his location

\end{itemize} 
If one or more necessary information is not inserted (missing) the user will be notified with an appropriate pop-up.
