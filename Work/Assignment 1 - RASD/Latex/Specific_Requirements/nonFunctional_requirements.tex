\section{Non Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Performance requirements}
The performance of the web and mobile applications are strictly related on the performances of the internet connection of the devices they are running on. The interfaces must not cause any delay in the interaction.
\subsection{Availability}
The system must work 24/24 7/7 with a maximum fault time of 1 hour / week
\subsection{Design constraints}
We don't have any particular design constraint.
