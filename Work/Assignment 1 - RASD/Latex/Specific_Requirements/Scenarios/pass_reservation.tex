\subsection{Passenger Reservation}
It is 9.00 in the morning and Tom has already downloaded the mobile application called \textit{myTaxiService} and he has a fixed appointment at 17.00 at "Stazione Centrale of Milano" so he decides to reserve a taxi for the 16.30 to go there. He enters in the apposite section of the application, indicates the source of the journey,the destination, the time of the meeting with the Taxi driver. He also specify the number of passengers that the Taxi will carry. The system, after a few seconds, reply positively to Tom saying that the reservation has been accepted and that the Taxi identification number will be provided 10 minutes before the meeting time.

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The system notifies the error to the Passenger
				\item Go back to Event flow \ref{fillForm}
			\end{enumerate}
			\item The reservation is stored in the system
			\item The system waits until 10 minutes before the date and time of the reservation
			\item The system checks the origin location provided by the Passenger and computes the corresponding zone in the city
			\item The system, based on the city zone computed, retrieves the corresponding taxi queue
			\item If there are no taxi in the queue: \label{noTaxi}
			\begin{enumerate}

				\item Go back to Event flow \ref{noTaxi}
			\end{enumerate}
