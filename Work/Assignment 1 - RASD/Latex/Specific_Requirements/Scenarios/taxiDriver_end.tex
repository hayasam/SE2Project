\subsection{Taxi driver: end of working day}
Bob is a Taxi driver that is finishing his working day. He has just finished his last ride and the passenger has just left the taxi. He takes his phone with the application \textit{myTaxiService} already running. He communicates to the system that he has ended the current ride. The system puts him in the taxi queue corresponding to his actual location.\\
Bob does not want to accept more requests and so he pushes the button devoted to the stopping of the incoming requests. The system removes him from the queue and his taxi is set as not available.
