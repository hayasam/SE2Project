\subsection{Taxi driver: acceptance of a request}
Bob is a Taxi driver that works in the large city and has already installed the application \textit{myTaxiService - Taxi Driver Edition}.
He is in the middle of his working day (so he has already executed the procedure at "Taxi driver: start of the working day") and he is waiting in a taxi queue corresponding to his actual location in the city.\\
Suddenly a pop-up shows up saying that there is a new request for a ride and he is asked to say if he wants to accept it or not.
He press the button "YES" and another screen opens specifying the location of the Passenger. The systems automatically sets the Bob's taxi as "busy" (not available): the taxi is removed from the taxi queue\\
Bob go to the location specified, picks up Alice and brings her to her desired location. At the end of the ride, Bob press the button "End of the ride" on the screen. The system computes his actual location and puts him in the nearest taxi queue.
