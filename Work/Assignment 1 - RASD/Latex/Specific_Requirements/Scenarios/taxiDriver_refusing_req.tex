\subsection{Taxi driver: refusing a request}
\subsubsection{Scenario}
Bob is a Taxi driver that works in the large city and has already installed the application \textit{myTaxiService - Taxi Driver Edition}.
He is in the middle of his working day (so he has already executed the procedure at "Taxi driver: start of the working day") and he is waiting in a taxi queue corresponding to his actual location in the city.\\
Suddenly a pop-up shows up saying that there is a new request for a ride and he is asked to say if he wants to accept it or not.\\
He refuses the request because he \textit{wants to watch the world burn} (Batman citation). The system puts Bob at the bottom of the taxi queue and re-forwards the request to the new first taxi driver of the queue.

\subsubsection{Use case}
See table \ref{requestTaxiUC} and table \ref{reserveTaxiUC}
