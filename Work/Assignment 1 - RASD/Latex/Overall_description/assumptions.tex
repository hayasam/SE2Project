\section{Assumptions and dependencies}
These are our assumptions about the problem domain:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each smart phone used by the Taxi drivers has a GPS system installed and the application has the privileges to access  it
\item Once a passenger made a request and it has been accepted by a taxi, he's going to wait for it until it arrives and he will take the ride
\item Once a taxi has accepted a request, it will reach the passenger and it will give him the ride
\item The taxi drivers will set their availability only when they can accept new passengers
\item The Passenger, once ended the ride, will pay the Taxi Driver directly. There is no support for an in-app payment system
\item The Passengers need to register to the system (username + password) in order to use it
\item Passengers can't access to the mobile application used by the Taxi Drivers
\item The Taxi drivers will register to the system with a specific request to the Government of the city. There is no support for taxi driver registration in the system.
\item Passengers, once submitted a request, will never try to cancel it.
\item The Passengers will request rides from a location inside the city to a location inside the city
\item We assume that every Taxi Driver, once he accepted a request, will reach the meeting point
\item There is absolutely no overlapping between taxi zones
\end{itemize}
