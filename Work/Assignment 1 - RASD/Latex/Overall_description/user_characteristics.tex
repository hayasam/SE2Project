\section{User characteristics}
The application addresses two specific kinds of users: \textit{Passengers} and \textit{Taxi drivers}
\subsection{User class 1: \textit{Passengers}}
A Passenger is a user with these characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item He owns a smart phone
\item He is able to install a mobile application on his smart phone
\item He owns/has access to a computer
\item He has access to the Internet
\item He is able to use a web browser
\end{itemize}
We can consider a passenger every person which wants to use the taxi service of the large city. They can be citizens of the city, tourists or simply visitors.
\subsection{User class 2: \textit{Taxi drivers}}
A Taxi Driver is a user with these characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item He is a employee of a taxi enterprise having its location in the city
\item The taxi enterprise has registered his taxi drivers to the system
\item He owns/has access to a smart phone (maybe provided by the enterprise)
\item He is able to install a mobile application on his smart phone
\end{itemize}
Taxi Drivers need to respond to every ride request in the shortest time possible. In a large city like the one we are working for this means that their time schedule is always full of requests during their working hours.
