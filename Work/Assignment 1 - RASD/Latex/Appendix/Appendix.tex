\section{Working hours}
This document was written in a total amount of around 40 hours divided so between the two group elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Luca Nanni: 20 hours
\item Giacomo Servadei: 20 hours
\end{itemize}
The two group elements were not in charge of a particular section/chapter but both worked together at the whole document.
