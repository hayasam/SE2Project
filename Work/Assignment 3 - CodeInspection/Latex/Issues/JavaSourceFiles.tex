\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{19}
	\item Each Java source file contains a single public class or interface.
	\begin{itemize}
	 	\item Class: \cmark
	\end{itemize}
	\item The public class is the first class or interface in the file.
	\begin{itemize}
	 	\item Class: \cmark 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Check that the external program interfaces are implemented consistently with what is described in the javadoc.
	\begin{itemize}
	 	\item Class: \cmark
	\end{itemize}
	\item Check that the javadoc is complete
	\begin{itemize}
	 	\item Method 1: \xmark\\
	 	The Javadoc is not complete: it does not explain what this method is for and does not describe the kind and the role of the output of this method.
 		\item Method 2: \xmark\\
 		The Javadoc is present and it gives a small description of what the method returns. But it does not give a general description of the method and of its parameters.
