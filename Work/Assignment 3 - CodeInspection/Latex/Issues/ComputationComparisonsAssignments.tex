\subsection{Computation, Comparisons and Assignments}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{43}
	\item Check that the implementation avoids 'brutish programming':
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Method 1: \cmark
		\item Method 2:
	\end{itemize}
	\item Check order of computation/evaluation, operator precedence and parenthesizing:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Method 1: \cmark
		\item Method 2:
	\end{itemize}
	\item Check the liberal use of parenthesis is used to avoid operator precedence problems:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Method 1: \cmark
		\item Method 2: 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Check that all denominators of a division are prevented from being zero:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Method 1: \cmark
		\item Method 2:
	\end{itemize}
	\item Check that integer arithmetic, especially division, are used appropriately to avoid causing unexpected truncation/rounding:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Method 1: \cmark
		\item Method 2:
	\end{itemize}
	\item Check that the comparison and Boolean operators are correct:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Method 1: \cmark
		\item Method 2: 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Check throw-catch expressions, and check that the error condition is actually legitimate:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Method 1: \cmark
		\item Method 2: 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Check that the code is free of any implicit type conversions: ********* NOT SURE *********
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Method 1: 
		\item Method 2: 
	\end{itemize}
