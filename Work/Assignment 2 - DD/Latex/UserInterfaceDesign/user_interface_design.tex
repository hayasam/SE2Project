\chapter{User interface design}\label{chapter:userInterfaceDesign}
\paragraph{}We have already dealt with the interface design in the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document, where we have shown some mock-ups of the screens of our applications.\\ In this section we will refine the user interface basically from the point of view of \textit{interaction} with the end-user (mapping between a sequence of actions and a screen flow).
