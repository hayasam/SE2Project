\section{Scope}
\paragraph{} This document is intended to be a description of the architecture of the software system \textit{myTaxiService}, commissioned by the government of a big city which wants to improve and automatize the managing of taxis and the calling system for the users.
\paragraph{} In particular we will present different \textit{views} of the system representing different levels of abstraction: the user's point of view, an internal sight of the subsystems and their high level interaction and the communication interfaces that they use to interact. We will describe the chosen architectural styles and pattern, some fundamental algorithms and how our choices are mapped on the requirements elicited in the RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document).
